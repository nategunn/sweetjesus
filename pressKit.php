    <p>Sweet Jesus is a band founded in Seattle by songwriter Bobby Malvestuto, guitarist William Feffer, and drummer Chris Pitzen (Crystal Pistols).
    </p> 
    
    <p>They're initial release, a five song E.P. in 2005 recorded at Foundry Studios, garnered local radio airplay, and landed them a scene in the indie film "Homeland". </p>

	<p>Keyboardist Holly Waits Houser, and bassist Jeremy Michell were added to to the line-up later that year, filling out the live sound.</p>

	<p>Coming from a primarily acoustic guitar based background, Malvestuto's songwriting varies anywhere from classic pop to psych-folk and delta blues, with the bands second release "EP 2", leaning a lot more on blues.  The following releases saw Sweet Jesus undergo several line-up changes. Chris temporarily left the band, adding Glen Kearney on drums, who did the playing on "E.P." 2., giving the record a distinctively more laid back attack. Chris returned in 2011, while guitarist William Feffer left for California. On the band's third release "Night Life", Bobby and Chris decided to keep things minimal, and to play the live songs as a duo.They've released 3 E.P.s to date and have recently posted tracks from they're upcoming 2014 "Short Wave Oracle" album.</p>

	<p>Along with Bobby and Chris, the band currently features Ryan Hamilton on lead guitar/vocals, and Austin Rood bass/vocals.</p>
